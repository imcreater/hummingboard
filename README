Name:

   Hummingboard Mini Distribution

About:

   A basic GNU/Linux distribution for SolidRuns Hummingboard

Main features:

   * Arm Cortex A9 optimized
   * Glibc based toolchain
   * Systemd init system
   * GNU/Linux system utilities (no busybox)
   * Ethernet network support
   * OpenSSH client/server
   * Gstreamer-1.4.x (including iMX HW enc/dec plugins)

Main builds:

   fs      - Filesystem
   linux   - Linux kernel
   u-boot  - Bootloader

Quick build guide:

   $ git clone --recursive git://github.com/mini-distribution/hummingboard.git
   $ cd hummingboard
   $ buildgear build fs
   $ buildgear build u-boot

Prebuilt images:

   For demo purpose, prebuilt images are available here:
   http://mini-distribution.io/prebuilds/hummingboard

Installation:

   To install on SD card simply create your primary (rootfs) EXT4 partion and
   install SPL and u-boot.img as described in the steps found here:

   http://www.solid-run.com/wiki/Building_the_kernel_and_u-boot_for_the_CuBox-i_and_the_HummingBoard
   (See section "Flashing U-boot and the kernel - full example")

   Copy the boot directory in build/output to your primary (rootfs) partition.

   Extract build/output/fs.tar.gz to your rootfs partition.

Build system requirements:

   Tested on Ubuntu 14.10 Minimal (64-bit x86) with the following additional
   packages installed:

   $ sudo apt-get install unzip groff bison flex gperf texinfo xsltproc \
                          libtool libncurses5-dev gawk libexpat1-dev \
                          gettext u-boot-tools libglib2.0-dev intltool \
                          libxml2-utils docbook-xml cmake g++ pixz lzop \
                          u-boot-tools


   Also requires reconfiguring "/bin/sh" to use bash:

   $ sudo dpkg-reconfigure dash

   Fact: Many software distributions fail to build using the dash shell.

Known issues:

   None

Filesystem layout:

   /usr/bin/            User binaries
   /usr/sbin/           System binaries (daemons, system utilities, etc.)
   /usr/lib/            Libraries
   /usr/lib/<prog>/     Program specific libraries (plug-ins, addons, etc.)
   /usr/include/        Header files
   /usr/share/man/      Man pages
   /usr/share/<prog>/   Program data files shared across all architectures
   /usr/etc/<prog>/     Configuration files for user programs
   /etc/                Configuration files for system programs

   The filesystem directory hierachy is arranged according to the FHS 2.3 
   standard with the exceptions that /bin and /sbin are unused. Instead all
   software make use of /usr/bin and /usr/sbin. For backwards compatibility
   /bin and /sbin remain links to /usr/bin and /usr/sbin respectively.
